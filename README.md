# Tic-tac-toe
The game Tictactoe

The most interesting part of building this game was 
trying to figure out how to check who won without using
a long series of 'if' statements.

After a few failed attemps I managed to get it down to
two 'for' loops and one 'if/else' statement. I used the loops to
check the column and rows for three in a line while the 'if/else' took care of the 
diagonals.

While this may not be the most advanced project, I feel that it is
reinforcing the belief that I can build projects without the help 
of a tutorial to guide me through.
